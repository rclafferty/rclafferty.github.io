        <h1>Wrath of Raoden (Unity C#)</h1>

        <div class="project-image">

        </div>

        <p>I led a team of three developers in developing Wrath of Raoden with the intent to publish on the Google Play store. This game is a 2D roguelike dungeon crawler in which the player is tasked with defeating a godlike antagonist, Raoden, with the power to randomize elements of the world. The player must fight their way through three dungeons in a random order, fight the corresponding boss, and proceed to fight Raoden in the end to save the world.</p>
