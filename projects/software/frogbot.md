The FrogBot Discord Bot is a personal project I'm actively developing to enhance gaming experiences for my friends and I. This bot is designed to compare games between two Discord users and display a list of mutually owned games. Currently, this bot only supports the Steam gaming platform but I plan to expand to other platforms such as Epic Games.
