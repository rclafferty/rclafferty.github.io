description: 'I have recently been working through a tutorial about Machine Learning, some of which include Deep Learning. This tutorial walks through different types of problems that are solvable using machine learning and gives sample problems to solve in both Python (using Spyder) and R (using R Studio).'
what_i_learned: I learned UI design, events, and dynamically changing sprites to implement a rotation effect. I also learned about dynamically spawning random sprites and animations that can be attached to them for cool gameplay effects.
what_i_do_differently: There are some unfinished portions that I could polish up from a UI/UX perspective.
