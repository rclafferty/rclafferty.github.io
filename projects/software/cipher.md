description: 'The cipher implementations content was implemented as a way to practice concepts I was learning in my CSCE 877 Cryptography course at UNL.'
what_i_learned: I practiced the implementations for ciphers we went over in lecture.
what_i_do_differently: I could've tried to implement more ciphers, such as ECC, while actively enrolled in the course so to give me more practice.
