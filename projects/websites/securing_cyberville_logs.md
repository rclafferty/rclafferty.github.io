My first research project as a masters student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln was to take a video game I'd previously created and modify it to be part of a database-linked web application. I took my undergraduate senior project, Securing Cyberville, and added log events to a database to track scene transitions, loot drops, and dialogue interactions. From there, I read the event logs from the database to a PHP-based web application that was searchable and sortable.
