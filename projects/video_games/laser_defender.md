description: 'Laser Defender was a fun Unity C# game based on a Galaga-type influence that was developed as part of a tutorial on Udemy. It was used to learn 2D collisions, events, player controls, and more from a top-down shooter perspective.'
what_i_learned: I learned UI design, events, and dynamically changing sprites to implement a rotation effect. I also learned about dynamically spawning random sprites and animations that can be attached to them for cool gameplay effects.
what_i_do_differently: There are some unfinished portions that I could polish up from a UI/UX perspective.
