description: 'Glitch Garden was a 2D tower defense game developed as part of a tutorial on Udemy, which goes over basic 2D sprite imports, character movement, character animation, point system management, and more.'
what_i_learned: I learned a lot about 2D animation and how to trigger events or methods from within an animation, such as firing a projectile at a given point in the animation. I also learned a lot about 2D design in general for that style of a project.
what_i_do_differently: I am still actively developing it when I have time and am continuing to learn.
