description: 'Transformation was a game developed for the Chillennium 2018 Game Jam based on the "Transformation" theme. In this game, the premise is that the player is a part of a special weapons project designed to create super humans. The player eventually becomes aware of this and solicits help from a friend (another test subject) to escape the program. The player must fight past enemies to escape the program and will either transform into a better person or into the monster that the program intended to create depending on the actions of the player.'
what_i_learned: I learned a lot about importing 3D models with rigging in them, moving the 3D animated models, and how to follow the player. I also learned about the graphical limitations of Unity (and how to work with these limitations) when we hit a point where Unity could not render the graphics correctly due to an excessively detailed model in the scene.
what_i_do_differently: I wouldn't do much differently simply due to the fact that the pure amount of knowledge my team gained from the project was worth the learning process.
