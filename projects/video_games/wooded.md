description: 'Wooded was created at the Kansas State University Annual Game Jam in February 2019 based on the theme "Left Behind." I worked alongside two other team members to develop this game using Unity 2018.3, with my primary roles including level design, UI design, event scripting, tilemap, and some art using Photoshop. This game features original art and original music, as everything in the game was created from scratch.'
what_i_learned: I learned how to use Photoshop for developing the title screen text art ("Wooded", "Start", and "Quit"). I also learned about tilemaps and how to use them to implement the maze, the forest, and a river scene (not implemented in the game jam build).
what_i_do_differently: I would've researched more efficient use of tilemaps, but it wasn't bad for my first time.
