description: 'CryoCrypt was developed by myself and three others at the 2015 Kansas State University Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours based on a given theme: "Securing the Future." Two teammates used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft the art for characters and scenery while myself and one other teammate focused on using Unity C# scripts to program the puzzles, algorithms, movement, timers, and more.'
extra_notes: This game was awarded Best Art, Best Gameplay, and Best Overall at the First Annual Kansas State University Game Jam.
what_i_learned: I learned a lot about programming in Unity during that weekend, because that was my first exposure to Unity. I also learned how to quickly collaborate with a new team in order to build a fully-functioning game. Finally, I improved my presentation skills by presenting to the judges and the general public at the end of the competition.
what_i_do_differently: Whereas I feel this was a very rewarding and eye-opening experience, I feel like I focused too much on the "competition" aspect and not enough on building comradery with fellow students. I have since learned from this and participated in later competitions with a more open mind.
