description: 'Basketball 3D is a small Unity game that emulates a player shooting hoops on a baskeball court. It uses simple shapes (cubes, spheres, etc) to make the scene and currently simple materials to add color. It is a good demo to learn and review 3D physics in Unity.'
what_i_learned: Reviewed 3D physics and controls, Learned about particle effects
what_i_do_differently: I could expand on the artistic look of the environment more.
