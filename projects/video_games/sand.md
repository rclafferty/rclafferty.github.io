description: 'Sand was developed by myself and three others at the 2016 Texas A&M Chillennium Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours. All aspects of this game except the music were made by hand. I found and implemented open source audio files for background music and sound effects. One teammate used Adobe Photoshop to create the art while myself and three others used Unity C# scripts to program character movement, enemy activity, interactivity, controls, and more.'
what_i_learned: This was my first opportunity to work in-depth with creating a multiplayer game. It was a bit of a challenge separating controls between P1 and P2 but my team's 3 programmers all worked together to overcome that challenge. I also got to explore more parts of Unity that I'd never used before, specifically things such as controller inputs.
what_i_do_differently: I enjoyed the game jam as a whole so I wouldn't change too much. I would say that being more well-versed in game development, specifically Unity, would've been a great help. This would allow me to spend less time researching and more time developing the game.
