Wooded was created at the Kansas State University Annual Game Jam in February 2019 based on the theme \"Left Behind.\" I worked alongside two other team members to develop this game with my primary roles including level design, UI design, event scripting, tilemap, and some art using Photoshop. This game features original art and original music, as everything in the game was created from scratch.
