CryoCrypt was developed by myself and three others at the 2015 Kansas State University Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours based on a given theme: \"Securing the Future.\" Two teammates used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft the art for characters and scenery while myself and one other teammate focused on using Unity C# scripts to program the puzzles, algorithms, movement, timers, and more.
