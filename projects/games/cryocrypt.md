what_i_learned: "I learned about programming in Unity during that weekend, because that was my first exposure to Unity. I also learned how to quickly collaborate with a new team in order to build a fully-functioning game. Finally, I improved my presentation skills by presenting to the judges and the general public at the end of the competition."
