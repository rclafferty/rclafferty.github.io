Leaf Me Alone was developed by myself and two others at the 2020 Kansas State University Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours based on a given theme: \"What Goes Up Must Come Down\" One teammate used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft the art for characters and scenery, one teammate assembled the scene and did UI scripting, while I focused primarily on character movement, physics, animations, chopping mechanics, apple mechanics, and general scripting.
