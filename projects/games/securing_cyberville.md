Securing Cyberville was created as a senior project at Kansas State University. I worked alongside one other team member throughout the semester to create this game. As a team, we started with researching how people learn about cyber security threatsand used that to brainstorm gameplay ideas and map the world. The game was created using the Unity game engine, Creative Commons models, and Creative Commons textures.
