The game was created using the Unity game engine, Creative Commons models, and Creative Commons textures."

what_i_learned: "I researched a lot to develop this project, including both educational aspects and game development aspects. For education, I researched how students learn and discovered some ways to connect that to gameplay. These ideas included enforcing the idea of what people can control and what may be out of their control, such as emphasizing using a firewall, using an antivirus, frequent cleaning of a system, and more. For game development, I researched realistic car mechanics, UI tools, and manipulating event listeners to dynamically implement the chat tree for story progression."
