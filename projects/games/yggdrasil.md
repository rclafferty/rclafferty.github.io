Yggdrasil was a product game made for Kansas State University's 4th Annual Game Jam, created by myself and three others. This project was created using the Unity game engine, Blender (for 3D models), and open-licensed audio and textures. Yggdrasil was later recreated as Yggdrasil V2 as a personal project to improve the terrain feel.
