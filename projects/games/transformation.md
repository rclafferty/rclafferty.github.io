Transformation was a game developed for the Chillennium 2018 Game Jam based on the "Transformation" theme. In this game, the premise is that the player is a part of a special weapons project designed to create super humans. The player eventually becomes aware of this and solicits help from a friend, another test subject, to escape the program. The player must fight past enemies to escape the program and will either transform into a better person or into the monster that the program intended to create depending on the actions of the player.
