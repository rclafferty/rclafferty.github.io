project_blurb: "Transformation was a game developed for the Chillennium 2018 Game Jam based on the \"Transformation\" theme. In this game, the premise is that the player is a part of a special weapons project designed to create super humans. The player eventually becomes aware of this and solicits help from a friend, another test subject, to escape the program. The player must fight past enemies to escape the program and will either transform into a better person or into the monster that the program intended to create depending on the actions of the player."

what_i_learned: "I learned about importing 3D models with rigging in them, moving the 3D animated models, and how to follow the player. I also learned about the graphical limitations of Unity and how to work with these limitations when we hit a point where Unity could not render the graphics correctly due to an excessively detailed model in the scene."
