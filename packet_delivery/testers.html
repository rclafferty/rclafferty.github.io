                    <p>I am a master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development. I am a co-founder of the <a href="https://UNL-Game-Dev-Club.github.io" target="_blank">UNL Game Development Club</a> and researching educational game development/gamification as my master's thesis under Dr. Stephen Cooper.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your willingness to participate in my study! I'm Casey Lafferty, a current masters student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln researching gamification. This study is designed to analyze the effect of using an educational video game to teach a Computer Science topic. Detailed instructions are provided below. If you have any questions about the instructions, the materials, or general questions, please contact me via email at <strong>rclafferty@huskers.unl.edu</strong> and I'll be glad to help.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Should you wish to discuss this game with me or other testers, you're welcome to email me at <strong>rclafferty@huskers.unl.edu</strong> or join my discord server at <a href="https://discord.gg/7Agub5F" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/7Agub5F</a>. You may freely discuss whatever you wish about the game on that server. If you have friends who would like to be testers, please contact me and let me know directly so that I may verify they're not potential study participants.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <li>A graphics card will help with graphical performance but is not required to run this game.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Starting now through the end of the study, do not share any game content with other people outside of my <a href="https://discord.gg/7Agub5F">discord server</a>. It is likely that you know potential study participants. If you have friends who would like to be testers, please contact me and let me know directly so that I may verify they're not potential study participants.</li>
                <li>Fill out the feedback form (via the link below) when you've completed the game.</li>
                <li>If any questions are unclear, feel free to reach out directly to me at <strong>rclafferty@huskers.unl.edu</strong> for clarification.</li>

            <p><strong>Game Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This game is to teach the DNS Lookup process. If you're unfamiliar with DNS lookup, please do not feel intimidated.</li>
                <li>You must complete the "Where Credit is Due" upgrade to complete the game.</li>
                <li>Controls will be explained in-game, requiring only a mouse and keyboard.</li>
