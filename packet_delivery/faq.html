            <p>Thank you for your willingness to participate in my study! I'm Casey Lafferty, a current masters student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln researching gamification. This study is designed to analyze the effect of using an educational video game to teach a Computer Science topic. Detailed instructions are provided below. If you have any questions about the instructions, the materials, or general questions, please contact me via email at <strong>rclafferty@huskers.unl.edu</strong> and I'll be glad to help.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Should you wish to discuss this game with me or other testers, you're welcome to email me at <strong>rclafferty@huskers.unl.edu</strong> or join my discord server at <a href="https://discord.gg/7Agub5F" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/7Agub5F</a>. You may freely discuss whatever you wish about the game on that server. If you have friends who would like to be testers, please contact me and let me know directly so that I may verify they're not potential study participants. You will be notified when the study is completed, which will likely be the end of August 2020.</p>
