# rclafferty.github.io
My website, posted on GitHub to show the code and reflect my HTML/CSS/PHP skill set
This repository will represent the code posted at the following URL:
    http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~rclafferty/

master:
    The master branch is HTML/CSS so that my website may be successfully built and hosted by GitHub using the following URL:
        https://rclafferty.github.io
      
PHP: (Defunct)
    The PHP branch is a reflection of the code that was posted on my website when using a PHP version. GitHub Pages will not host PHP code for the website, unfortunately.


new-design:
    The new-design branch shows any new code I'm currently working on but not yet published
