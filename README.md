# rclafferty.github.io
My website, posted on GitHub to show the code and reflect my HTML/CSS/PHP skill set
This repository will represent the code posted at the following URL:
      http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~rclafferty/

master:
  The master branch is HTML/CSS so that my website may be successfully built and hosted by GitHub using the following URL:
      https://rclafferty.github.io
      
PHP:
  The PHP branch is a reflection of the code that is ACTUALLY posted on my website. GitHub will not host PHP code for the website, unfortunately.

new_design:
   The new_design branch shows the new code I'm working on, but is not yet published.
