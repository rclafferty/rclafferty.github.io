                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a fourth-semester master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I am currently working towards my thesis, which centers around the concept gamification and educational (or "serious") game development. This thesis work is under the direction of Dr. Stephen Cooper. I also have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies in cyber security and video game development.</p>
                
                <h3>Extra Curricular - Masters</h3>
                <p>Aside from being a graduate student, I'm also a co-founder of the <a href="http://UNL-Game-Dev-Club.github.io" target="_blank" title="UNL Game Dev Club Website">UNL Game Development Club</a>, which helps students develop skills in game design, game programming, and game art. My contributions to the club thus far include developing the <a href="http://UNL-Game-Dev-Club.github.io" target="_blank" title="UNL Game Dev Club Website">club's website</a>, creating <a href="http://github.com/UNL-Game-Dev-Club" target="_blank" title="UNL Game Dev Club GitHub">tutorials</a> to help students learn basic Unity skills, leading game jam teams, and more. I like to participate in game development competitions ("Game Jams"), where teams of up to four people can compete to develop a game in 48-hours based on a given theme. Most of my game jam games I've developed over the past four years can be found on my <a href="http://github.com/rclafferty" target="_blank" title="Casey's GitHub Page">GitHub page</a>. My most recent games include <a href="http://github.com/UNL-Game-Dev-Club/Wooded" target="_blank" title="Wooded - GitHub">Wooded (KSU Game Jam 2019)</a>, <a href="http://github.com/UNL-Game-Dev-Club/Transformation" target="_blank" title="Transformation - GitHub">Transformation (Chillennium 2018)</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/rclafferty/Yggdrasil" target="_blank" title="Yggdrasil - GitHub">Yggdrasil (KSU Game Jam 2018)</a>.</p>

                <h3>Game Dev - Undergrad</h3>
                <p>Game development is a hobby inspired by my coursework and extra-curricular activities at K-State. I was a contender in the three K-State game jams in my undergrad and have attended two more as a graduate student. I enjoy competing because it is a great opportunity to highlight skills, network with colleagues and industry representatives, and learn new skills. In my first game jam, I had little experience in game development and absolutely no experience with game engines such as Unity or Unreal. I was fortunate to team up with someone who was familiar with Unity and learned a lot on the spot. In that same competition, we created CryoCrypt and were awarded Best Art, Best Gameplay, and Best Overall.</p>
                <p>I also had the privilege of attending the 2016 and 2018 Chillennium Game Jam at Texas A&M University. This game jam is organized strictly by students for students and hosted by their Department of Visualization. It was a great opportunity to network with out-of-state students as well as companies based closer to Texas such as EA, Blizzard, Six Foot, and more. I personally had a blast and look forward to attending again in the future.</p>

                <h3>ACM Programming Competitions</h3>
                <p>Every semester, Kansas State University hosts their local Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Programming Competition, which mirrors the structure of the regional and world competitions. I have had the privilege of competing in seven total K-State Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) programming competitions and two regional competitions. I was fortunate to place in the top five twice at the local competitions and in the top 33&percnt; both times in the regional competitions. I enjoyed the rush of the competitions and the learning experience that accompanied it.</p>

                <h3>Boy Scouts of America</h3>
                <p>I was a part of the Boy Scouts of America for 16 years, starting with my Tiger cub group in August of 2000. Since then, I continued on into Boy Scouts in 2005, joined Venturing in 2009, and earned the rank of Eagle in September 2012. I stayed involved in Venturing as an adult advisor for Crew 75 in Manhattan, KS until May 2016. I enjoy staying involved because it is a great program and would like to see it continue.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>Music Extracurriculars</h3>
                <p>As a music minor, I often found myself involved in music-related events, such as performing with community choirs, or music-related aspects of software development, to include audio and music for game development. In the 2015 holiday season, I auditioned and was chosen to be a part of Disney's World of Color Honor Choir. Many US singers submitted recordings of themselves singing individual parts of Glow, the song commissioned by Disney for this event, and submitted for selection. Roughly 700 recordings were chosen, combined into one (fantastic) video and projected onto a wall of water at California Adventure Park during the annual World of Color show. It was a great experience that I was also lucky enough to see it in-person.</p>
                <p>Another recent musical experience was the World Choral Festival. I had the pleasure of performing with singers from the USA, Ireland, England, Czech Republic, and a few other places for a week in Kansas City during summer 2016, which concluded with a final performance in the Kauffman Performing Arts Center. We performed songs from different composers in many different languages. It was a great bonding and networking experience for everyone involved.</p>
