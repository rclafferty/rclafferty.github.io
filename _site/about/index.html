<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where I received my master’s degree in Computer Science researching educational video games. I also have a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development.</p>

<h3 id="game-dev---masters">Game Dev - Masters</h3>
<p>During my graduate studies, I have developed games as part of my academic studies and for competitions (“Game Jams”). For my thesis, I’ve developed <a href="/games/packet_delivery.html" title="Packet Delivery">Packet Delivery</a>, which is an educational video game designed to teach introductory Domain Name System (DNS) Lookup concepts. For more information about this game, including a video of it’s gameplay, visit the project page linked above. As an earlier iteration of this DNS game, I also developed <a href="/games/internet_inc.html" title="Internet, Inc.">Internet, Inc.</a> to show the lookup structure of the DNS Lookup process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m also the co-founder and former president of the <a href="/websites/unl_game_dev_club_website">UNL Game Development Club</a>, which helps students develop skills in game design, game programming, and game art. My main contributions to the club include organizing game jam teams to attend three major competitions, developing the <a href="/websites/unl_game_dev_club_website">club’s website</a>, developing the club’s logistical database, and creating tutorials to help students learn basic Unity skills. In graduate school, I have competed in five in-person game jams and two online game jams. This is in addition to the four game jams from my time as an undergraduate student. Most of these competition projects can be found on my <a href="http://github.com/rclafferty" title="Casey's GitHub Page">GitHub page</a>, the most recent of which include <a href="/games/leaf_me_alone.html" title="Leaf Me Alone!">Leaf Me Alone! (KSU Game Jam 2020)</a> and <a href="/games/the_three_mutineers.html" title="The Three Mutineers">The Three Mutineers (Chillennium 2019)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="game-dev---undergrad">Game Dev - Undergrad</h3>
<p>During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to pursue game development in both my academic studies and through game jam competitions. I took two game engine design classes, which inspired me to pursue game jams. I competed in four in-person game jams in my undergrad and later seven other competitions in my graduate studies. I enjoy competing because it is a great opportunity to highlight skills, network with colleagues and industry representatives, and learn new skills. In my first game jam, I had little experience in game development and absolutely no experience with game engines such as Unity or Unreal. I was fortunate to team up with someone who was familiar with Unity and learned a lot on the spot. In that same competition, we created <a href="/games/cryocrypt.html" title="CryoCrypt">CryoCrypt (KSU Game Jam 2015)</a> and were awarded Best Art, Best Gameplay, and Best Overall.</p>

<h3 id="acm-programming-competitions">ACM Programming Competitions</h3>
<p>Every semester, Kansas State University hosts their local Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Programming Competition, which mirrors the structure of the regional and world competitions. I have had the privilege of competing in seven total K-State Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) programming competitions and two regional competitions. I was fortunate to place in the top five twice at the local competitions and in the top 33&amp;percnt; both times in the regional competitions. I enjoyed the rush of the competitions and the learning experience that accompanied it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a graduate student, I’ve had the opportunity to assist in organizing the regional-level competitions. As part of this duty, I was tasked with organizing volunteers for all designated competition areas and acting as the point-of-contact for all volunteer questions and concerns.</p>

<h3 id="boy-scouts-of-america">Boy Scouts of America</h3>
<p>I was a part of the Boy Scouts of America for 16 years, starting with my Tiger cub group in August of 2000. Since then, I continued on into Boy Scouts in 2005, joined Venturing in 2009, and earned the rank of Eagle in September 2012. I stayed involved in Venturing as an adult advisor for Crew 75 in Manhattan, KS until May 2016. I enjoy staying involved because it is a great program and would like to see it continue.</p>

<h3 id="music-extracurriculars">Music Extracurriculars</h3>
<p>While I was at KSU, I also got a minor in music. As a music minor, I often found myself involved in music-related events, such as performing with community choirs, or music-related aspects of software development, to include audio and music for game development. In the 2015 holiday season, I auditioned and was chosen to be a part of Disney’s World of Color Honor Choir. Many US singers submitted recordings of themselves singing individual parts of Glow, the song commissioned by Disney for this event, and submitted for selection. Roughly 700 recordings were chosen, combined into one (fantastic) video and projected onto a wall of water at California Adventure Park during the annual World of Color show. It was a great experience that I was also lucky enough to see it in-person.</p>

<p>Another musical experience was the World Choral Festival. I had the pleasure of performing with singers from the USA, Ireland, England, Czech Republic, and a few other places for a week in Kansas City during summer 2016, which concluded with a final performance in the Kauffman Performing Arts Center. We performed songs from different composers in many different languages. It was a great bonding and networking experience for everyone involved.</p>
