    <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where I received my master's degree in Computer Science researching educational video games. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development.

    <br> <br>

    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

<p>CryoCrypt was developed by myself and three others at the 2015 Kansas State University Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours based on a given theme: "Securing the Future." Two teammates used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft the art for characters and scenery while myself and one other teammate focused on using Unity C# scripts to program the puzzles, algorithms, movement, timers, and more.</p>

<h3>What have I learned from this project?</h3>
<p>
    I learned about programming in Unity during that weekend, because that was my first exposure to Unity. I also learned how to quickly collaborate with a new team in order to build a fully-functioning game. Finally, I improved my presentation skills by presenting to the judges and the general public at the end of the competition.
