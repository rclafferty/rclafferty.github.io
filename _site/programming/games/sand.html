    <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where I received my master's degree in Computer Science researching educational video games. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development.

    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

<p>Sand was developed by myself and three others at the 2016 Texas A&M Chillennium Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours. All aspects of this game except the music were made by hand. I found and implemented open source audio files for background music and sound effects. One teammate used Adobe Photoshop to create the art while myself and three others used Unity C# scripts to program character movement, enemy activity, interactivity, controls, and more.</p>

<h3>What have I learned from this project?</h3>
<p>
    This was my first opportunity to work in-depth with creating a multiplayer game. It was a bit of a challenge separating controls between player 1 and player 2 but my team's 3 programmers all worked together to overcome that challenge. I also got to explore more parts of Unity that I'd never used before, specifically controller inputs.
