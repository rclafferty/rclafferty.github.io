				<a href="about.html"><h2>Robert Casey Lafferty</h2></a>
				<p>I am a recent graduate of Kansas State University's Computer Science program with a minor in Music. I will attend University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the fall as a Master's student studying Artificial Intelligence. My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

			<h2>Academic Interests</h2>
		</div>

		<p>I'm involved in the <a href="http://ksucyberdefencenews.blogspot.com">Cyber Defense Club</a> (CDC) at Kansas State University. In this club, they expose members to vulnerabilities in software and techniques to defend against them. I'm still relatively new to the club and hope to get more involved as the year progresses. I'm also interested in the competitions that they often attend. In addition to this, I've also taken the Intro to Cyber Security (CIS 490) course at K-State. Combining that knowledge with the CDC gives me an opportunity to expand on what I've learned which I am very eager to pursue.</p>
		<p>I'm also involved in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kddresearch">Laboratory for Knowledge Discovery in Databases</a> (aka "KDD Lab") under Dr William Hsu. This lab focuses on conducting real-world research using artificial intelligence. I'm still relatively new to the group as well as artificial intelligence research in general. Regardless, I hope to learn a lot this year.</p>

			<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
		</div>

		<p>My most rewarding work experience thus far has been my job as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) at K-State. I have been a UTA for two classes: <a href="http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~russfeld/cis115fall2016/">CIS 115 (Introduction to Programming Languages)</a> and CIS 200 (Fundamentals of Programming). I was a UTA for CIS 200 from August 2014 to December 2015. During that time, I was a lab assistant and helped students learn Java alongside one other UTA and a GTA. They used Java via the Eclipse IDE to solve problems in lab once a week for 16 weeks. Aside from this, I started as a UTA for CIS 115 in August 2015 and have continued to this day. In this class, students learn the fundamentals of the Computer Science field. This includes programming as well as the history, the different areas within Computer Science, and more.</p>
		<h3>Why is this job rewarding to me?</h3>
		<p>Simply, I enjoy helping others. I often go out of my way to assist students who are lost or struggling. The most rewarding moments come when I visit with students from previous semesters and discuss their achievements, internships, or other progress in the field. Some of them are UTAs for other classes, whereas others have excelled in programming competitions or game jams. In a sense, this also reminds me of my own experiences and how far I've progressed in a few short years.</p>

			<h2>Extra-Curricular Activities</h2>
		</div>

		<h3>ACM Programming Competition</h3>
		<p>Every semester, Kansas State University hosts their local Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Programming Competition, which mirrors the structure of the regional and world competitions. So far, I've competed in 6 total local competitions, each time on a team of 3 people. I've also had the privilege of competing in the ACM regional competition at University of Nebraska in Lincoln 1 time. I have been fortunate to place in the top 5 twice at the local competitions: 4th place in Spring 2015 and 5th place in Fall 2014. I will continue to compete so long as I am at K-State because I enjoy the rush of the competition and also view this as a good opportunity to explore new problems. Every semester, my team walks away with problems that we hope to continue pursuing as a learning experience and use that to prepare for future competitions.</p>

		<h3>Game Jams</h3>
		<p>Within the past 2 years, I have gotten involved in video game development mainly by taking the Game Engine Design course (CIS 585) and participating in game jams. K-State has hosted two annual game jam competitions, both of which I have participated in. I enjoy competing very much because it is a great opportunity to showcase skills, to network with many new people, and to learn new skills. In my first game jam, I had little experience in game development and absolutely no experience with game engines such as Unity or Unreal. I was fortunate to team up with someone who was familiar with Unity and was able to learn a lot on the spot. In that same competition, we created <a href="index_test.html">CryoCrypt</a> and were awarded Best Art, Best Gameplay, and Best Overall.</p>
		<p>I also recently had the privilege of attending the <a href="http://www.chillennium.com/">Chillennium Game Jam</a> at Texas A&M University. This game jam is organized strictly by students for students and hosted by their Department of Visualization. It was a great opportunity to network with out-of-state students as well as companies based closer to Texas such as EA, Blizzard, Six Foot, and more. I personally had a blast and look forward to attending again in the future.</p>
		<h3>Boy Scouts of America</h3>
		<p>I have been a part of the Boy Scouts of America for 16 years now, starting with my Tiger cub group in August of 2000. Since then, I continued on into Boy Scouts in 2005, joined Venturing in 2009, and earned the rank of Eagle in September 2012. I am still involved in Venturing as an adult advisor for Crew 75 in Manhattan, KS. I enjoy staying involved because it is a great program and would like to see it continue.</p>

		<h3>Music Extracurriculars</h3>
		
		<p>As a music minor, I often find myself involved in music-related events, such as performing with community choirs, or music-related aspects of software development, to include audio and music for game development. In the 2015 holiday season, I auditioned and was chosen to be a part of <a href="http://ericwhitacre.com/glow">Disney's World of Color Honor Choir</a>. Many US singers submitted recordings of themselves singing individual parts of Glow, the song commissioned by Disney for this event, and submitted for selection. Roughly 700 recordings were chosen, combined into one (fantastic) video and projected onto a wall of water at California Adventure Park during the annual World of Color show. It was a great experience that I was also lucky enough to see it in-person.</p>
		<p>Another recent musical experience was the <a href="http://www.worldchoralfestival.com">World Choral Festival</a>. I had the pleasure of performing with singers from the USA, Ireland, England, Czech Republic, and a few other places for a week in Kansas City this summer (2016), which concluded with a final performance in the Kauffman Performing Arts Center. We performed songs from different composers in many different languages. It was a great bonding and networking experience for everyone involved. I look forward to participating again in the next one, which will be in Summer 2018.</p>
