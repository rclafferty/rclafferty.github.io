                    <p>I am a master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development. I am a co-founder of the <a href="https://UNL-Game-Dev-Club.github.io" target="_blank">UNL Game Development Club</a> and researching educational game development/gamification as my master's thesis under Dr. Stephen Cooper.</p>

            <p>Securing Cyberville was created as a senior project at Kansas State University. I worked alongside one other team member throughout the semester to create this game. As a team, we started with researching how people learn about cyber security threatsand used that to brainstorm gameplay ideas and map the world. The game was created using the Unity game engine, Creative Commons models, and Creative Commons textures.</p>

            <h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
            <p>I researched a lot to develop this project, including both educational aspects and game development aspects. For education, I researched how students learn and discovered some ways to connect that to gameplay. These ideas included enforcing the idea of what people can control and what may be out of their control, such as emphasizing using a firewall, using an antivirus, frequent cleaning of a system, and more. For game development, I researched realistic car mechanics, UI tools, and manipulating event listeners to dynamically implement the chat tree for story progression.</p>
