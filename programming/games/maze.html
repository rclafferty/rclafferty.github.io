						<h2><a href="maze_1st_person.zip" target="_self">3D Maze Desktop Video Game (C#)</a></h2>
						<h4>Note: Designed for Windows computer. Controller is optional.<br><i>Should not require admin privileges</i></h4>
						
						<p>This <a href="maze_1st_person.zip" target="_self">3D Maze game</a> was created as a side project inspired by a game idea for the 2016 Kansas State University's Game Jam. I have created everything through Unity, to include the modelling. It was created recently and is still a work-in-progress but so far I have a ball controlled by the player that rolls from one side of the maze to the other side. I hope to create gameplay that will involve a picking up items to gain points and other sorts of interactivity. I also hope to add menus and smoother entrance/exit processes. Menus I hope to add include: start screen, controls screen, frequently asked questions or advice, and more.</p>
						<p>This game has a 1st person and 3rd person version. Both versions use the arrow keys and WASD controls to move. The 1st person version uses mouse movement to look around and rotate the player.</p>
						<h3><em>What have I learned from this?</em></h3>
						<p>I learned a lot about the Unity Input Manager to allow inputs from both mouse/keyboard and controllers, I reviewed 3D collision detection, and learned how to use multiple views to have a "minimap" type of view in the corner.</p>
						<h3><em>What do I wish to improve or add?</em></h3>
						<p>I will add menus such as the start screen, controls, frequently asked questions, and more as needed. I also hope to make the "minimap" type of view look nicer. I hope to improve collision actions and add interactivity with other objects throughout the maze.</p>
