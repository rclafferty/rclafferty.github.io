                    <p>I am a master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development. I am a co-founder of the <a href="https://UNL-Game-Dev-Club.github.io" target="_blank">UNL Game Development Club</a> and researching educational game development/gamification as my master's thesis under Dr. Stephen Cooper.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

            <h1>Wooded (Unity C#)</h1>

            </div>

            <p>Wooded was created at the Kansas State University Annual Game Jam in February 2019 based on the theme "Left Behind." I worked alongside two other team members to develop this game with my primary roles including level design, UI design, event scripting, tilemap, and some art using Photoshop. This game features original art and original music, as everything in the game was created from scratch.</p>

            <h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
            <p>I learned how to use Photoshop for developing the title screen text art ("Wooded", "Start", and "Quit"). I also learned about tilemaps and how to use them to implement the maze and the forest.</p>
