            <p>Transformation was a game developed for the Chillennium 2018 Game Jam based on the "Transformation" theme. In this game, the premise is that the player is a part of a special weapons project designed to create super humans. The player eventually becomes aware of this and solicits help from a friend (another test subject) to escape the program. The player must fight past enemies to escape the program and will either transform into a better person or into the monster that the program intended to create depending on the actions of the player.</p>

            <h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
            <p>I learned about importing 3D models with rigging in them, moving the 3D animated models, and how to follow the player. I also learned about the graphical limitations of Unity and how to work with these limitations when we hit a point where Unity could not render the graphics correctly due to an excessively detailed model in the scene.</p>
