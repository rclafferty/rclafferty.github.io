                    <p>I am a fourth semester master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development. I am currently the president of the <a href="https://UNL-Game-Dev-Club.github.io" target="_blank">UNL Game Development Club</a> and studying educational game development/gamification as my master's thesis under Dr. Stephen Cooper.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

            <p>Yggdrasil was a product game made for Kansas State University's 4th Annual Game Jam, created by myself and three others. On this team, there were two programmers, two artists, and all four of us contributed to designing the story, levels, and overall design. This project was created using the Unity game engine, Blender (for 3D models), and open-licensed audio and textures.</p>

            <h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
            <p>I learned about designing terrains and collision problems involved with doing so. Terrains were a very large part of designing our main map. I also learned about particle effects to design multiple aspects of the game, including the fire effects on the title screen and the effects in the torch on the main map.</p>

            <h3>Is there anything I'd do differently?</h3>
            <p>We had a lot of GitHub issues that my team is better prepared to handle now. We also had a lot of model import issues and my team has since determined the root cause of those issues.</p>
