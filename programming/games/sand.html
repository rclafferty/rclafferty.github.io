                    <p>I am a master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development. I am a co-founder of the <a href="https://UNL-Game-Dev-Club.github.io" target="_blank">UNL Game Development Club</a> and researching educational game development/gamification as my master's thesis under Dr. Stephen Cooper.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

            <h1>Sand (Unity C#)</h1>

            <p>Sand was developed by myself and three others at the 2016 Texas A&M Chillennium Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours. All aspects of this game except the music were made by hand. I found and implemented open source audio files for background music and sound effects. One teammate used Adobe Photoshop to create the art while myself and three others used Unity C# scripts to program character movement, enemy activity, interactivity, controls, and more.</p>

            <h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
            <p>This was my first opportunity to work in-depth with creating a multiplayer game. It was a bit of a challenge separating controls between P1 and P2 but my team's 3 programmers all worked together to overcome that challenge. I also got to explore more parts of Unity that I'd never used before, specifically things such as controller inputs.</p>
