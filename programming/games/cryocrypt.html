                    <p>I am a master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development. I am a co-founder of the <a href="https://UNL-Game-Dev-Club.github.io" target="_blank">UNL Game Development Club</a> and researching educational game development/gamification as my master's thesis under Dr. Stephen Cooper.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

            <h1>CryoCrypt (Unity C#)</h1>

            <iframe class="project_video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ajtABWDdYBo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>CryoCrypt was developed by myself and three others at the 2015 Kansas State University Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours based on a given theme: "Securing the Future." Two teammates used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft the art for characters and scenery while myself and one other teammate focused on using Unity C# scripts to program the puzzles, algorithms, movement, timers, and more.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This game was awarded Best Art, Best Gameplay, and Best Overall.</p>

            <h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
            <p>I learned a lot about programming in Unity during that weekend, because that was my first exposure to Unity. I also learned how to quickly collaborate with a new team in order to build a fully-functioning game. Finally, I improved my presentation skills by presenting to the judges and the general public at the end of the competition.</p>
