				<h2><a href="CryoCrypt.zip" target="_self">CryoCrypt Desktop Video Game (C#)</a></h2>
				<h4>Note: Designed for Windows computer. Controller is optional.<br><i>Should not require admin privileges</i></h4>
				
				<p><a href="CryoCrypt.zip" target="_self">CryoCrypt</a> was my first significant step into game development. I worked alongside 3 other team members at the 2015 Kansas State University Game Jam to create this game in a span of 48 hours. As a team, we started with brainstorming storyboard ideas, and then quickly moved into programming, art, and so forth. 2 students used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft the art for characters and scenery. Another team member and myself both focused on using Unity C# scripts in order to program the puzzles, algorithms, movement, timers, and more. Myself and 1 of the artists also recorded voices for the characters using Audacity. Unfortunately, the voice-overs are not implemented in this build. </p>
				<p>This game was awarded Best Art, Best Gameplay, and Best Overall.</p>
				<h3><em>What have I learned from this?</em></h3>
				<p>I learned a lot about programming in Unity during that weekend, because that was my first exposure to Unity. I also learned how to quickly collaborate with a new team in order to build a fully-functioning game. Finally, I improved my presentation skills by presenting to the judges and the general public at the end of the competition.</p>
				<h3><em>Is there anything I'd do differently?</em></h3>
				<p>Whereas I feel this was a very rewarding and eye-opening experience, I feel like I focused too much on the "competition" aspect and not enough on building comradery with fellow students. I have since learned from this and participated in later competitions with a more open mind.</p>
