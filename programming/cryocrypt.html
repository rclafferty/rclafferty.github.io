    <p>I am a third year master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development. I am currently the president of the <a href="https://go.unl.edu/gamedev//">UNL Game Development Club</a> and studying educational game development/gamification as my master's thesis under Dr. Stephen Cooper.</p>
    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

<p>CryoCrypt was developed by myself and three others at the 2015 Kansas State University Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours based on a given theme: "Securing the Future." Two teammates used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft the art for characters and scenery while myself and one other teammate focused on using Unity C# scripts to program the puzzles, algorithms, movement, timers, and more.</p>

<p>This game was awarded Best Art, Best Gameplay, and Best Overall at the First Annual Kansas State University Game Jam.</p>

<h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
<p>I learned a lot about programming in Unity during that weekend, because that was my first exposure to Unity. I also learned how to quickly collaborate with a new team in order to build a fully-functioning game. Finally, I improved my presentation skills by presenting to the judges and the general public at the end of the competition.</p>

<h3>Is there anything I'd do differently?</h3>
<p>Whereas I feel this was a very rewarding and eye-opening experience, I feel like I focused too much on the "competition" aspect and not enough on building comradery with fellow students. I have since learned from this and participated in later competitions with a more open mind.</p>
