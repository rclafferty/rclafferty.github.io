            <p>This household budgeting application was an application to give me practice developing a program that interacts with a backend database as well as a tool to help me track my personal finances. The idea for this application came from an online list of ideas for programmers.</p>

            <h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
            <p>Securely connecting a C# application to a database using PHP, practice in effective database design, practice in connecting a C# application to a database, scalability in applications of this style</p>

            <h3>Is there anything I'd do differently?</h3>
            <p>This is not a finished product but was archived due to lack of availability to actively pursue the project</p>
