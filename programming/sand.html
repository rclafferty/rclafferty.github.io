				<h4>Note: Designed for Windows computer. Requires 2 controllers<br><i>Should not require admin privileges</i></h4>
				<!--<p>Sand was created by a team of 4 students at the Texas A&M University Chillennium game jam in September 2016. All aspects of the game, excluding audio, were made my hand. 1 student used Adobe Photoshop to create the art and myself. Myself and 3 others used Unity 4 C# scripts to program character movement, interactivity, controls, and more. Everyone collaborated closely to develop gameplay, theme, and all other overall aspects of the game. I found and implemented open source audio for the background music as well as sound effects.</p>
				<h3><em>What have I learned from this?</em></h3>
				<p>This was my first opportunity to work in-depth with creating a multiplayer game. It was a bit of a challenge separating controls but my team's 3 programmers all worked together to overcome that challenge.</p>-->
				
				<p><a href="sand.zip" target="_self">Sand</a> was the product of my most recent Game Jam, which was Texas A&M University's Chillennium 2016. Teams from different parts of the country gathered to compete in this Game Jam and as a result, created some awesome games. My team consisted of 1 artist and 3 programmers. All aspects of this game, excluding audio, were made by hand. I found and implemented open source audio files for the background music as well as sound effects. 1 student used Adobe Photoshop to create the art. Myself and 3 others used Unity C# scripts to program character movement, enemy activity, interactivity, controls, and more. Everyone collaborated closely to develop gameplay, theme, and other overall aspects of the game.</p>
				<h3><em>What have I learned from this?</em></h3>
				<p>This was my first opportunity to work in-depth with creating a multiplayer game. It was a bit of a challenge separating controls between P1 and P2 but my team's 3 programmers all worked together to overcome that challenge. I also got to explore more parts of Unity that I'd never used before, specifically things such as controller inputs.</p>
				<h3><em>Is there anything I'd do differently?</em></h3>
				<p>I enjoyed the game jam as a whole so I wouldn't change too much. I would say that being more well-versed in game development, specifically Unity, would've been a great help. This would allow me to spend less time researching and more time developing the game.</p>
