    <p>I am a third year master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Kansas State University, where I focused my studies on cyber security and video game development. I am currently the president of the <a href="https://go.unl.edu/gamedev//">UNL Game Development Club</a> and studying educational game development/gamification as my master's thesis under Dr. Stephen Cooper.</p>
    <p>My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.</p>

<p>Sand was developed by myself and three others at the 2016 Texas A&M Chillennium Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours. All aspects of this game except the music were made by hand. I found and implemented open source audio files for background music and sound effects. One teammate used Adobe Photoshop to create the art while myself and three others used Unity C# scripts to program character movement, enemy activity, interactivity, controls, and more.</p>

<h3>What have I learned from this?</h3>
<p>This was my first opportunity to work in-depth with creating a multiplayer game. It was a bit of a challenge separating controls between P1 and P2 but my team's 3 programmers all worked together to overcome that challenge. I also got to explore more parts of Unity that I'd never used before, specifically things such as controller inputs.</p>

<h3>Is there anything I'd do differently?</h3>
<p>I enjoyed the game jam as a whole so I wouldn't change too much. I would say that being more well-versed in game development, specifically Unity, would've been a great help. This would allow me to spend less time researching and more time developing the game.</p>
