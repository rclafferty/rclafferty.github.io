        <h1>UNL GDC Admin Database (Python, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3)</h1>

        </div>

        <p>The UNL Game Development Club's Admin Database was created as both a class project and a club project. This database was designed to track club member information, including year, major, meeting attendance, event attendance, and contact information. As part of the class project, this information was put into several D3JS templates to visualize the data in four different charts. The project and the report can be found at the GitHub link below. In addition to the class project, I developed a script to interface with this database that sent emails to all club members using their registered information.</p>
