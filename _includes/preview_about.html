<h3>Masters Work</h3>
<p>My research is in gamification, studying the effectiveness of using an educational video game to teach a Computer Science topic. This work is under the direction of Dr. Stephen Cooper. I am also the president of the UNL Game Development Club. As president, I've helped organize events, demos, management systems for listservs and attendance tracking, and manage the website. My most recent games in relation to these two roles include Packet Delivery (Masters Thesis), Wooded (KSU Game Jam 2019), Transformation (Chillennium 2018), and Yggdrasil (KSU Game Jam 2018), all of which can be found on my GitHub page along with other projects.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate Work</h3>
<p>I completed my undergraduate work at Kansas State University. My senior project was an educational video game was Securing Cyberville, an educational video game in cyber security. During my undergrad years, I participated in four game jams, seven programming competitions, and was an undergraduate teaching assistant for three years.</p>

<h3>Extracurriculars</h3>
<p>In addition to my Computer Science work, I'm also an Eagle Scout and a Music minor. I earned the rank of Eagle in 2012 and continued on with Venturing until May 2016, part of which was as an adult leader. In music, I was often a part of community choirs, virtual choirs, or music-related aspects of software development. The most notable accomplishments in my music career are being a part of the World of Color Honor Choir (2014) and the World Choral Festival (2016). The World of Color Honor Choir was a virtual choir that created a pre-recorded video to display at Disney's World of Color show in Anaheim, CA. The World Choral Festival was a group of singers from around the world who gathered in Kansas City to perform a full set of choral pieces in the Kauffman Center of Performing Arts.
