				<a href="about.html"><h2>Robert Casey Lafferty</h2></a>
				<p>I'm a fifth year undergraduate student at Kansas State University majoring in Computer Science. My interests include software development, game development, cyber security, artificial intelligence, web development, and more. I am also a music minor with a vocal emphasis. I have played cello and sang in choirs since 2004, and performed in many theatrical productions since 2006. I would like to find a way to combine music and Computer Science in my future career if possible.</p>
